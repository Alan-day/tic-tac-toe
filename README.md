# tic-tac-toe

a simple tic-tac-toe game

User starts a game by pressing the start button and lasts until one of the players wins or a draw. First player is an "x" and x starts the game. Every box has an event listener attached to it and upon each click the for each loop runs over if statements that decide whether to mark the field or not. Win condition loops over an array that specifies winning combinations.

///additional points
New Game should start the new game without pressing the start button but after nesting the startGame function it didn't do anything.
I had difficulties with using the confetti package but I'm sure that I'd manage to get it working if I had more time

//commits

I have only few commits for that project as I did most of the work witin the same day
